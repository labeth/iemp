# IEMP Signal generator firmware

This does not build, can't find all the sources i need and its for an old version of arduino.

This is a fork of http://iteadstudio.com/Downloadfile/IEMP/IEMP_firmware_0.1b.rar

The Simple Arduino DDS Signal Generator is a opensource hardware platform http://store.iteadstudio.com/index.php?cPath=29_31&main_page=product_info&products_id=450

I don't know the license of the original source (found in inital-commit).

When and if i do updates to the code you will be able to find them here.

Can't find the correct version of the Nokia 3310 display driver. Added the best one i could find from an other of the other projects from the same manufacturer.

Maybe change to https://github.com/imclab/nokia_3310_lcd or https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit-PCD8544-Nokia-5110-LCD-library

Make sure to use something like this https://www.hackster.io/rayburne/avr-firmware-duplicator-115d8f to backup the original image.
